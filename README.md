This document contains the work for lab 3 of GEGO 458. This lab explores how to design an interactive web map. The lab draws on the critical ideas that web maps need to include styling and elements to create legitbilty and appeal to users. The map created in this assignment is an example of the ideas explored in the course content. 

This map displays some brief information regarding airports in the United States. The map displays the city in which each airport is located, if they have an air control tower, and the number of airports per state. The map utilizes information from data.gov(info about airports) and Mike Bostock (information about airports per state)(attribution is given). The map utilizes several libraries including leaflet, chroma, jquery, and google fonts. 

The map depicted in this lab provides a brief demonstation on the skills touched on in the course.
